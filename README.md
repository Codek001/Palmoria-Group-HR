## Palmoria Group HR Analysis Report

## Backstory

The Palmoria Group, a prominent manufacturing company based in Nigeria, has recently come under scrutiny due to allegations of gender inequality across its three regional offices. The media has highlighted these issues with the headline "Palmoria, the Manufacturing Patriarchy," which poses a significant threat to the company's reputation and its ambitions to expand both regionally and internationally.

In response to these allegations, the CEO, Mr. Ayodeji Chukwuma, has tasked the Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO), Mr. Yunus Shofoluwe, with addressing these concerns promptly. Mr. Shofoluwe has enlisted the help of an HR Analytics expert to analyze the company's HR data and provide actionable insights to rectify these issues. The future of gender equality at Palmoria is now in the hands of this expert team.

## Data Cleaning Process Using Power Query

To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the analysis, a thorough data cleaning process was conducted using Power Query. The following steps were taken:

1. **Handling Missing Gender Data**: 
   - Employees who did not disclose their gender were assigned a generic gender status to ensure inclusivity in the analysis.

2. **Excluding Former Employees**:
   - Employees without a salary were identified as no longer being with the company and were removed from the dataset to maintain the relevance of the analysis.

3. **Removing Null Departments**:
   - Records with departments indicated as "NULL" were excluded from the dataset. This step reduced the total row count from 1015 to 946, ensuring that only valid and complete data was used in the analysis.

These data cleaning steps were crucial in preparing the dataset for a comprehensive analysis of gender-related issues within the Palmoria Group. The cleaned data will be used to generate insights and visualizations that will guide the management team in making informed decisions to promote gender equality within the organization.
